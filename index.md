## About

Semantic research in the Montagovian tradition has taken an experimental turn in the last decade, as the empirical goals of semanticists have gotten more ambitious.
Large-scale inference datasets—and the statistical models they require—have become a more standard part of the semanticist's toolkit.
`pds` is an approach to developing models of inference datasets that involves seamlessly deriving them from semantic grammar fragments.

As a library, `pds` encodes the ideas described in [Probabilistic Dynamic Semantics](https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/008478) by [Julian Grove](https://juliangrove.github.io/) and [Aaron Steven White](https://aaronstevenwhite.io/).
Applications of the framework can also be found in [Grove and White (2025a)](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/007450) and [Grove and White (2025b)](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ELM/article/view/5857).
